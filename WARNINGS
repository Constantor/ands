WARNINGS

- Make sure that I'm using "X is None" or "X is not None" in conditions, when I really mean that X should be respectively None or not None.
In other words, I should not be using "X" or "not X", because "X" could be 0, and could conceptually still be a "valid input".

- In the README file, the section on how to run tests doesn't describe how to run a single test

- Also I should specify that now you can run a specific test also with run.sh

- in the section Tests, I could link the user to articles talking about test-driven development (TDD)

- The content section could be described in more detail, maybe by pointing to the CHANGES.md

- Concepts that do not fit in a single sub-package or script could be put in the notes folder
