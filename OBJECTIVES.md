# Objectives

1. Learn the concepts related to the most interesting algorithms and data structures related (but not only) to the following fields:

	- Searching
	- Sorting
	- Dynamic programming
	- Greedy algorithms
	- Graphs
	- Trees
	- Hash tables
	- Heaps
	- Artificial intelligence
	- Numerical computing
	- Linear algebra algorithms
	- Geometrical algorithms
	- Approximation algorithms
	- Heuristics
		
2. Implement as many as possible of the most interesting and useful algorithms and data structures in the fields mentioned above.
Here interesting can be from the implementation or concepts' point of view. Usefulness instead is especially with respect to me (since so far this is a personal project), but also with respect to any student or person involved in one of the fields mentioned above.

3. Learn to analyse the asymptotic complexity of the algorithms and in particular of their implementation.

4. Prefer quality (i.e., completeness, correctness) and clarity over quantity of the work done.
	
	- Consequences:

		- Rate of implementation of new algorithms and data structures may be slow.
		
		- Greater reliability of the implementations and information given.

	- Specific goals:

		- Describe clearly the concepts,
		as if it was an explanation to someone who has almost no experience or knowledge of what's being described, without sacrifying rigor.

		- Add comments where appropriate with respect to the previous goal.

		- Specify exactly the coding (and naming) conventions being used. 

		- Specify exactly how the concept has been implemented. Try to emphasize the difference between the abstract concept and the specific implementation using specific techniques, so that the user does not confuse the two.

        - Every method should have an asymptotic analysis associated with it. This analysis should obviously be related to the specific implementation and this should be noted.

        - Link to resources used to implement the concepts.

5. Learn how to create unit tests. Specifically I should at least consider the following techniques:

	- Equivalence partioning

	- Boundary values

	- Statement coverage

6. Learn new programming techniques, tools and paradigms:
	
	- Learn to decide which tools are best to do a job

	- Learn which paradigm is better for a particular implementation

	- Learn test-driven development

7. Learn new Python techniques
