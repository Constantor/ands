# Greedy Algorithms

Some useful resources to know more about greedy algorithms:

- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm)
- [Introduction to Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms) (3rd edition) by CLRS

## TODO

- Greedy graph coloring (does not produce an optimal solution!)

- Change making, which does not produce always an optimal solution. I have already implemented a change making algorithm, which produces an optimal solution, using dynamic programming.
