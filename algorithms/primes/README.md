# Primes

Primes are interesting numbers. A prime is a number that is greater than 1 and is divisible only by itself and 1. The only even number that is prime is 2. Therefore, all primes different from 2 are odd. 1 could be considered a prime, since it is divible only by itself and 1 (itself), but it isn't because it is "convenient" to considered it a non-prime number for a few reasons. One of them is that the [_fundamental theorem of arithmetic_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic) would break if 1 was prime.
