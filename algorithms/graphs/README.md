# Algorithms that run mainly on graphs

## TODO

The following are some algorithms that I would really like to include.


- Create a function that build returns a list of shortest paths representing the "sink tree", i.e. a tree that is constructed by finding all the shortest paths to a specific node.

- Find bridge: find an edge that would disconnect the graph if it is connected, or it would create more connected components if it's already disconnected. This information is useful because we might need to know which parts of the graph are at risk of being unreachable.

- Two-CNF-SAT
