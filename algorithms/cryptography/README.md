# Cryptography

Nowadays, there are two main classes of symmetric encryption techniques (i.e. ciphers where both keys of the sender and receiver are the same): _stream ciphers_ and _block ciphers_.

### Block Ciphers

In a block cipher, the message to be encrypted is processed in blocks of k bits. For example, if k = 64, then the message is broken into 64-bit blocks, and each block is encrypted independently. To encode a block, the cipher uses a one-to-one mapping to map the k-bit block of cleartext to a k-bit block of ciphertext
