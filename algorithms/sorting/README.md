# Sorting algorithms

Under this folder you can find some of the most famous sorting algorithms, such as quick sort, merge sort or insertion sort.

All algorithms in this folder are in-place except from merge sort.

All algorithms output an increasing sorted list.
If you want a decreasing sorted list, you can use the function `reverse` that you find in `util.py`, or you can simply use the `reverse` method of your `list` object, which might also be faster (for some reason) than the one I provide.

The time complexities of the algorithms can be found in the doc-strings of the function. Unless otherwise specified, time complexities are for the worst case.

Other descriptions might be provided, but this is not sure (for now).

In general, I try to specify the type of each argument,
but I might also have forgotten to do it in some places.
