# Data Structures


## TODO

Where `F` indicates that I've already started implementing the data structure, but it needs to be finished, and `S` indicates that nothing has been done yet.

### Self-balancing binary-search trees

|                 Name                | State     | Comments                                                        |
|:-----------------------------------:|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| AVL Tree                            | S  | Based highly on rotations. It's more rigid in terms of ensuring logarithmic height than RBTs. First self-balancing binary-search tree invented, in 1962.                                                               |
| Splay tree                          | S  |                                                                 |
| Treap                          | S  |                                                                 |
| 2-3 tree                          | S  |                                                                 |


### Heaps

|                 Name                | State     | Comments                                                        |
|:-----------------------------------:|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Min-max heap                         | S  | Fast "find-min" and "find-max" operations. Useful to implement double-ended priority queues.                                                                |


### Other

|                 Name                | State     | Comments                                                        |
|:-----------------------------------:|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Adjacency matrix representation of a graph | S  | Convert all current algorithms that work with the adjacent list |
| TST                                 | F |                                                                 |
| B-Tree                              | S  |                                                                 |
| Radix-Tree                          | S  | What's the difference between Trie or Radix-Trie?               |
| Trie                                | S  | What's the difference between Radix-Tree or Radix-Trie?         |
| Hash-Table                          | F |                                                                 |
| Double-Ended Priority Queue         | S  | This might be implemented using a min-max heap.                 |
| Skip list | S | |
| Leftist tree | S | |
