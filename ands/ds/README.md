# Data Structures


## TODO

Where `F` indicates that I've already started implementing the data structure, but it needs to be finished, and `S` indicates that nothing has been done yet.

### Self-balancing binary-search trees

| AVL Tree                            | S  | Based highly on rotations. It's more rigid in terms of ensuring logarithmic height than RBTs. First self-balancing binary-search tree invented, in 1962.                                                               
| 2-3 tree                          | S  |

| Splay tree                          | S  |                                                                 |

| Double-Ended Priority Queue         | S  | This might be straightforward implemented using a min-max heap, which is already implemented.                 |
| TST                                 | F |                                                                 
| Fibonacci heap | S | Performs better than a normal binary heap|
| Binomial heap | S | Supports better the merge of heaps |
| Adjacency matrix representation of a graph | S  | Convert all current algorithms that work with the adjacent list |
| B-Tree                              | S  |                                                                 | Radix-Tree                          | S  | What's the difference between Trie or Radix-Trie?               |
| Trie                                | S  | What's the difference between Radix-Tree or Radix-Trie?         |
