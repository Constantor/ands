# Algorithms that run mainly on graphs

Probably, the most basic and fundamental graph algorithms are BFS and DFS, which can be used by other more complex algorithms...

## TODO

The following are some algorithms that I would really like to include.


- Create a function that build returns a list of shortest paths representing the "sink tree", i.e. a tree that is constructed by finding all the shortest paths to a specific node.

- Find bridge: find an edge that would disconnect the graph if it is connected, or it would create more connected components if it's already disconnected. This information is useful because we might need to know which parts of the graph are at risk of being unreachable.

- Two-CNF-SAT (also related to dynamic programming)

- Find strongly connected components

- Find connected components with DFS

- Maximal connected subgraph

- Iterative version of DFS

- 2-edge connectivity
