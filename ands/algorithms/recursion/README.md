# Recursion


Algorithms that use recursion that do not fall in any more specific category and  which are, in my opinion, good and simple examples of recursive algorithms.

There are other recursive algorithms in this project that would also be good examples to show how recursion works, for example [`quick_sort`](../sorting/quick_sort.py), but I thought they would be better examples of other concepts.
