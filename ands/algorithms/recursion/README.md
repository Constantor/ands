# Recursive Algorithms

Algorithms that use recursion that do not fall in any more specific category. For example, the problem "the nth fibonacci number" can be solved using recursion, but it can also be solved more interestingly using dynamic programming, and so you can find those algorithms (including the recursive one) under the folder `dp`.
