# Greedy Algorithms

Note that algorithms that you might find under [graphs](../graphs), such as [Kruskal](../graphs/kruskal.py)'s and [Prim](../graphs/prim.py)'s or the [Reverse-delete algorithm](Reverse-delete algorithm) algorithms to find minimum-spanning are greedy algorithms. Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm is also a greedy algorithm.

## TODO

- Greedy graph coloring (does not produce an optimal solution!)

- Change making, which does not produce always an optimal solution. I have already implemented a change making algorithm, which produces an optimal solution, using dynamic programming.

- [Reverse-delete algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse-delete_algorithm) to find a minimum spanning tree.
