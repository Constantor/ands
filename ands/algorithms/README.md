# Algorithms

I would like to include algorithms regarding the following topics:

- Linear algebra (Guassian, RREF, Jacobi, determinants, ...)
- Numerical computing (PDE, ODE, Poisson, Social Networks, Graph Partioning, Conjugate Gradient, Page Rank, Horner...)
- Linear programming
- Artificial intelligence (Swarm intelligence, A<sup>*</sup>, Genetic algorithms, ...)
- Geometrical algorithms (Convex hull, ...)
- Generation of random numbers
- Error correction codes
- CNF, DNF, 2-satisfiability
- Equations (quadratic, cubic and quartic equations formulas ...)
- Heuristics to NP-complete problems


A more exhaustive list of interesting algorithms can be found here:
